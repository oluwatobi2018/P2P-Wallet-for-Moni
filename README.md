# P2P Wallet for Moni
 A simple p2p wallet for payments. This solution was developed using node.js, Typescript and MongoDB.
 I created a simple P2P wallet system with the following features

- Users should be able to fund their wallets on the system - (Use [**Paystack](https://paystack.com/docs/api/)** funding options) keys : `PUBLIC KEY pk_test_f1bdf35e9e5ab3f840a73caaeefe6b6de5ed387d, SECRET KEY sk_test_9369f28cc8a60025ccf2a058216b7d51932f0b0f`
- Users should be able to send funds to other users on the system
i also built a Frontend demoing how my backend service works.
